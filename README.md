# dough-e - Wholesale Bakery Management Application
## A Ruby on Rails Full-Stack App
## Purpose
An intuitive easy to use interface with different dashboards and authorizations for customers & administrators. On the admin side the home dashboard loads to the day's production list based on orders created by company users or admins. THe admin dashboard allows access to companies,users, products, open & closed orders. The customer side allows access to current and past orders and the product catalog, and loads to a current open order or the product catalog if there is no open order.

I have used two differet bakery software systems adn both were outdated in both UI/UX and databse design. They required a savvy user tyo get the full benefit of the system, a cost many bakeries cannot afford.

Dough-e will be intuitive for even basic computer users. It allows quick access to pertinent info without weighing down the users with endless checkboxes and choices. The databse is designed for ease of data retrievel. This easy retrieval will allow me to continue to grow the app starting with invoice access and invoice crediting.
